For example, the minimum and maximum levels of relevant income in respect of a relevant employee, who is remunerated on a monthly basis and commences employment on 20 December 2000, would be HK$4,000 and HK$20,000 respectively for determination of mandatory contributions required for the first contribution period from 20 December 2000 to 31 December 2000. Similar treatment should be applied to a relevant employee who ceases employment during a contribution period.</p>
