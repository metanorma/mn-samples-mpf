	<p id="_cd19a999-b619-4336-92d2-fecf8cb104bc">The Authority imposes a number of conditions when approving applications to become an approved MPF trustee. One of these requires trustees to take all reasonable steps to ensure that only registered MPF intermediaries induce or seek to induce another to become a participating employer or member of the Scheme. In addition, the Code of Conduct states that trustees have a duty to use their best endeavours to supervise and exercise proper control over persons selling / advising on MPF schemes. It is therefore expected that trustees would endeavour to ensure that the standards of conduct set out in the Code, are met by their intermediaries. Trustees should have the necessary tools at their disposal to facilitate this and where problems arise, the ability to take (either directly or indirectly) the appropriate remedial action. The Authority is aware that many trustees already have written undertakings from their promoters concerning the lattersâ€™ intermediaries adherence to the Code of Conduct. The Authority commends this and would encourage all trustees to adopt the practice.</p>

Some promoters and corporate intermediaries rely predominately on self-declaration by the individuals concerned. Others have instituted various checking mechanisms which go beyond sole reliance on self-declaration, including, obtaining written confirmation from the relevant employer. This particular practice is encouraged. As a best practice, trustees are encouraged to satisfy themselves with the verification mechanism (i.e. the processes) adopted by their promoters / corporate intermediaries. In addition, either they, or the promoters / corporate intermediaries are encouraged to conduct random spot-checks (as far as this is practicable) to verify that these requirements have been met in respect of those individual intermediaries with whom they have a working relationship.</p>
